  Chef and PoolParty

%p
  Lets start off with a basic example:

  ~file_to_code("snippets/basic_chef.rb")

%p
  %tt include_recipes
  specifies a glob of 
  =link "cookbooks"
  that will be placed into your
  =link "suitcase"
  at time of deployment. These cookbooks are then made 
  %em available
  to your recipes

%p
  %tt recipe
  specifes a particular 
  =link "recipe" 
  that you want to use when 
  =link "configuring"
  your
  =link "instances."
  Typically you specify only
  %strong one
  recipe in your 
  %tt clouds.rb
  and this recipe calls as many recipes as needed.
