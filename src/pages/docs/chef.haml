  Chef and PoolParty

%p
  Lets start off with a basic example:

  ~file_to_code("snippets/basic_chef.rb")

%p 
  You can specify the location for your chef repository. This must be local or an absolute path to the chef repository you are referring to. PoolParty will build the dna.json based on the chef_attributes that you supply as well as the recipes that you use.
