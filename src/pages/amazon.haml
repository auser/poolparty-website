%h2 Terminology 

.callout
  For PoolParty and general cloud computing terminology 
  =link "Check here", "language.html"

=define_term "EC2" do
  A platform for launching machine 
  =link "instances", "language.html#instance"

=define_term "AMI" do
  Amazon Machine Image. Conceptually similar to a Xen or VMware image. There are hundreds of pre-built AMI's for you to choose from. PoolParty uses ec2ubuntu.

=define_term "S3" do
  Simple Storage Service (S3). Persistent data storage. Data is stored in 'buckets'. EC2 
  %strong does not
  use S3 
  %em directly

=define_term "EBS" do
  Elastic Block Store. Persistent disks for EC2 instances. Can store 
  %em snapshots
  on S3. Its fast but only mounts to
  %strong one
  instance at a time. i.e. It is not a SAN.

=define_term "Elastic IP" do
  Typical EC2 instance IPs are dynamic and assigned at boot time. Elastic IPs provide a way for you to assign static IPs to nodes.

=define_term "Security Groups" do
  Amazon has a strict firewall between the world and your nodes and between nodes within EC2. Each instance is assigned to one (or more?) security group. Each security group has its own set of security policies. These policies can be controlled by using the
  %tt ec2-authorize
  binary.
  
  In the 
  %tt default
  security group, all nodes have unlimited (network) access to each other. Everything else is turned off. (This includes port 22 for 
  %tt ssh 
  and port 80 for 
  %tt http
  )

=define_term "Cloud Front" do
  Amazon's pay-as-you-go "self service" CDN. You upload files to S3 and then they are available through public URLs.

=define_term "Keypairs" do
  todo
