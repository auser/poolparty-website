%h1 VMware (Fusion) and PoolParty setup

%p
  PoolParty supports VMware as a 
  =link "remoter base.", "language.html#remoter_base"
  This allows one to test
  %tt clouds.rb
  files without the cost of booting and shutting down cloud 
  =link "instances.", "language.html#instance"
  Currently, this has only been tested on Mac OSX with VMware Fusion. In theory, it should work on any machine with the
  %tt vmrun
  binary installed.

  %ol
    %li 
      %p
        Download
        =link "VMware Fusion", "https://www.vmware.com/tryvmware/?p=fusion"
    %li
      %p
        Download the
        =link "Ubuntu VMware image", "http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2009/04/ubuntu-904-on-vmware-fusion-2.html"
        Make sure you can already boot it up and you have internet connectivity 
    %li 
      %p
        You must be able to access the image when the instance boots up.
        Therefore you need to install your public key and take a snapshot of
        the image.

      %p 
        Add your public key to the list of authorized keys on the root user 
        %strong on the image

      %p
        For example:

        :syntaxhighlighter
          scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@local_vmware_ip:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys

      %p 
        Then 
        %strong take a snapshot
        I call my snapshot 
        %tt base
        %p
        =img "screenshots/take_snapshot_1.png"

        %p
        =img "screenshots/snapshot_list.png"
        %center
          %em A list of snapshots


    %li 
      %p
        Make sure 
        %tt vmrun 
        is in your 
        %tt PATH

      %p
        For example, using VMware Fusion on Mac OSX add the following to your 
        %tt .profile
        :syntaxhighlighter
          #!highlighting syntax=shell-unix-generic
          export PATH=$PATH:/Library/Application\ Support/VMware\ Fusion

    %li
      %p
        enable vmrun in your 
        %tt clouds.rb

        %p

        :syntaxhighlighter
          clouds(:app) do
            # ...
            using :vmrun do
              vmx_hash({
                "/Users/alerner/Documents/Virtual Machines.localized/one.vmwarevm/Ubuntu Linux 32bit.vmx" => "192.168.248.128"
              })
            # ...
            end
          end

    %li 
      %p
        :syntaxhighlighter
          cloud start -d

      %p 
        Note: if you receive the message 
        %tt Your cloud is already running.
        That is probably because you already have VMware or possibly your image running. In this case simply
        %tt cloud provision 
        to provision your instances.
